# Student Database 2.0 (v1 was where I started C)

Yes, I know AI could do it in 10 minutes, but honestly? Screw you if you say that

A C project that manages student data using structs, file handling, and sorting.  
Features include:

- Add, view, edit, delete students
- Save to and read from files
- Export to CSV format
- Menu-based command line interface

This was my second major C project after `Report Card 3.0`.  
Built during my 10th grade mechatronics course in 2025.

> No GUI â€” this is pain coded raw in the terminal.
>Now made in VScode
